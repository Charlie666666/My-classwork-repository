# Charlie Cao's ICS3U classwork

Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I'm taking this course because I want to study computer science. I think it's an interesting subject. 
I want to learn how to make a simple game.

What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
I think Amoug Us is well designed. It seems like a simple game. But there are a lot of interesting tasks to be done. 
And each player has a random identity. I wanted to incorporate these interesting quests and random identities into my game.
